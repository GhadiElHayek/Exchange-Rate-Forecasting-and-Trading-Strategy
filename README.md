# Exchange-Rate-Forecasting-and-Trading-Strategy
A Python-based toolkit for analyzing and predicting exchange rate movements between spot and forward rates, implementing trading strategies, and evaluating performance through backtesting.
Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of exchange rates using historical spot and forward rate data. It provides a framework for forecasting future spot rates, developing trading strategies based on these predictions, and backtesting their performance. The tools included leverage Pythonâ€™s powerful data analysis libraries to model relationships and evaluate trading outcomes effectively.
